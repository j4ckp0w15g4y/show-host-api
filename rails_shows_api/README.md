# ShowHost

## Project Overview

'ShowHost' is an application that lists upcoming gigs in the user's local area. 

Users can search for upcoming gigs by genre, name, or date, and can then 'attend' shows which saves the show to the user's list.

### Technologies Used:

For this project I am using: 

- React
- Rails 
- CSS

### MVP
1. Users can search for gigs by genre, date, or by artist
2. Users can 'attend' gigs
3. Users can create, update, and delete events. 

I am essentially rendering information drawn from an API that I have created, and simultaneously implementing basic CRUD functionality.

### BONUS

- Users  can only create, update, and delete events if they are members of 'ShowHost'.
